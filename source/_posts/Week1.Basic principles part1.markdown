##1.2 Study designs##

###1.2.1 Introduction to study designs###

- why
- learnning outcome
- key topics

###1.2.2 Overview of research designs###

**Intervention:** By providing a group of subjects a certain type of diet and making a comparison with a group of subject that receives a different type of diet.

**Observation:** Not ask to change their dietary habits or take a pill or receives some other type of treatment.

**Food frequency questionnaires:**
Food intake is determined via special questionnaires(so called food frequency quesionnaires).

**advantages:** It is fairly efficient and can be used to collect the nutrient intake data of thousands of individuals.

**disadvantage:** People tend to be less than 100% frank when filling in these questionnaires,either consciously of subconsciouly, porentially resulting in large errors.

###1.2.3 Ecological Study###
- Ecological studies are a type of observational study in which the unit of analysis is populations or groups of people, rather than individuals.
- The unit of analysis in an ecological study is the group, any association between an exposure and outcome annnot automatically be extrapolated to individuals.

###1.2.4 Cross-sectional study###
- In cross-sectional studies exposure and outcome are measured at the same time, the exposure could be the consequence of the outcome instead of the other way around.
- The inability to assign the temporal relationship between exposure and outcome is the main limitation of cross-sectional studies. 

###1.2.5 Case control study###
- Case control studies are retrospective studies, which means that you look back into the past. 
- The major advantage of case-control studies is they allow you to study the link between diet and rare diseases
- Case-control studies can also be the victim of confounding.

###1.2.6 Cohort study###
- the major disadvantage of food frequency questionnaires is that the information collected may not always be very accurate
- Another limitation of cohort studies is confounding。

###1.2.7 Intervention study###
- The key feature of the experimental study or intervention is that you actually intervene.
You don’t just observe people but you change something and you can provide them with a pill or a certain type of diet or ask them to do something.
